Explanation of Changes

    BluetoothCtlWidget Class:

        A new class, BluetoothCtlWidget, has been added. It inherits from widget.base.ThreadPoolText to periodically check the Bluetooth status without blocking Qtile's main loop.

        poll(): This method runs every 5 seconds (the default update_interval), calling bluetoothctl show to determine if Bluetooth is "On" or "Off". It then formats the text for the bar.

        toggle_power(): This is bound to a left-click on the widget. It checks the current power state and issues the appropriate bluetoothctl power on or bluetoothctl power off command.

        open_bluetoothctl(): This is bound to a right-click. It launches a new kitty terminal window running an interactive bluetoothctl session.

    New Color Variables:

        color_blue = "#0000FF": A new variable for the color blue.

        color_bluetooth_chord_foreground and color_bluetooth_chord_background: These use the new blue color to style the chord indicator when the Bluetooth keychord is active.

    Bluetooth KeyChord:

        A new KeyChord is defined, triggered by Alt+b.

        It provides single-key shortcuts to run common bluetoothctl commands (scan on, pair, connect, etc.). Each command opens a new kitty terminal to show the output.

        The o keybinding provides a simple toggle for Bluetooth power.

    Bar and Widget Integration:

        An instance of our new BluetoothCtlWidget is added to the widgets list within the screens configuration. Its foreground color is set to color_blue.

        The existing widget.Chord has been updated to include the colors for the new "Bluetooth Control" chord, making it visually consistent with the other chords.

Prerequisites

For this configuration to work correctly, you need to ensure the following:

    Install Necessary Packages: You need the core Bluetooth utilities. On most Arch-based systems, you can install them with:

    sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils

    For audio devices, you'll also likely need:

    sudo pacman -S pulseaudio-bluetooth

    After installing, you may need to restart the bluetooth service:

    sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

    User Permissions: The bluetoothctl command often requires specific user permissions to function without sudo. Adding your user to the lp group is a common way to grant these permissions:

    sudo usermod -aG lp $USER

    You will need to log out and log back in for this group change to take effect.

After fulfilling these prerequisites and reloading Qtile (Super + Control + r), the Bluetooth widget should appear in your bar, and the Alt + b keychord should function as described.
